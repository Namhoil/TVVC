### A lightweight & advanced file explorer

TVVC isn't your ordinary file explorer.
On Windows, even after enabling the ability to view "hidden" files and folders, not all are actually shown, in Windows Explorer.
TVVC tackles this issue, and displays *everything* in the selected drive - no caveats.

This application uses WPF, thus allowing a much cleaner, more modern user interface (and better backend workings) than a WinForms
application of this sort would have.
